## Downloading z88dk

The latest version of z88dk is 2.1 and was released in
February 2021. You can download the release version from:

* GitHub http://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/releases
* Sourceforge: http://sf.net/projects/z88dk
* Docker: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/z88dk/z88dk

But, that's not recommended! We're always adding new features, and it's already out of date! It's much better to use the automated builds:

* Nightly: http://nightly.z88dk.org
* Snap: https://snapcraft.io/z88dk
* Docker: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/z88dk/z88dk
* Source: http://github.com/z88dk/z88dk

Staying current is the best way to experience z88dk, taking advantage of the enhancements that are regularly
added.

[Installation instructions](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki/installation) can be found on our wiki.

## Support

If something isn't quite right or just need to vent, please reach out - we know that out docs are a bit patchy in places.

Likewise if you need something new, poke us: Many of z88dk's features have been developed as a result of user request.

The best places are:

* The forum http://www.z88dk.org/forum
* Github issues: https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/issues
